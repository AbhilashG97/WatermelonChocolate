# Conditions 

There are three types of condition statements in ```Kotlin```, which are as follows - 

1. if 
2. if..else
3. when

:warning: The ```if``` and ```if..else``` statements are exactly the same as in ```Java```.  

The when statement on the other hand is a bit similar to the switch case in ```Java``` but it is far more versitile than the switch clause in ```Java```. 

## when statement

The ```when``` statement is similar to the switch statement in ```Java```. But it can do a lot more that that. 

The following features are new in the when clause when compared to the switch clause - 

1. Multiple cases can be placed in a single line
2. The switch condition comparision can be done in the body of the when clause.

Examples can be found [here](OrangyWatermelon.kt). 

:warning: ```run {} ``` has to be used to run an expression inside the forEach() function.
