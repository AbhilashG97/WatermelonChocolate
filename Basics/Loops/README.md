# Loops

Loops in ```Kotlin``` are somwhat similar to the loops present in ```Java```. 

:warning: The ```for loop``` in Kotlin is a bit different from the for loop in ```Java```.

### while and do..while loops

The ```while``` and ```do..while``` loops are exactly the same as in the Java. 

You can find examples [here](CrimsonMelon.kt)

### for loop

The for loop is a bit different in ```Kotlin```. 

:warning: The for loop construct works with iteration over ranges, collections, or other iterables. 

:boom: The ```in``` operator is often used with the for loop. 

You can find some examples [here](WatermelonIteration.kt)

A commonly used function and property with the for loop are - 

1. withIndex() [function]
2. indices [property]
