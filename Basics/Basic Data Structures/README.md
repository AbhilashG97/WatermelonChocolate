# Arrays

This section contains a few examples on how to use ```Kotlin``` Arrays. Also, a few methods to traverse the Array can also be found in the sample programs. 

There are two ways to create an Array in ```Kotlin```, which are as follows - 

1.  Using the constructor ```Array()```
1.  Using the helper function ```arrayOf()```

:warning: Along with the helper function, other utility functions are also available which can be used to create Arrays. 

Some of the utilty functions are as follows - 

1.  ```intArrayOf()```
1.  ```charArrayOf()```
1.  ```byteArrayOf()```
1. .....

and so on.
